"Text-Based Emotion Recognition Using NLP and Deep Learning"

This project focuses on **detecting human emotions from text-based input** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques.  
By recognizing emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, fear, and neutrality, the system enables **emotionally intelligent AI systems** capable of enhancing communication in applications like **virtual assistants**, **customer support**, and **mental health monitoring**.

# Project Overview

Emotion is a key aspect of human communication.  
This project aims to bridge the gap between **technology and human empathy** by enabling machines to understand emotional expressions in text.

The model takes **transcribed speech or text input**, processes it using **NLP pipelines**, and classifies it into predefined emotion categories.  
Advanced deep learning architectures such as **LSTM**, **BiLSTM**, or **Transformers (BERT)** are used for contextual understanding.

# Key Features

âœ… Classifies text into multiple emotional categories:  
> hate, neutral, anger, love, worry, relief, happiness, fun, empty, enthusiasm, sadness, surprise, boredom  

âœ… Splits dataset into **70% training and 30% testing**  
âœ… Evaluates model with **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**  
âœ… Generates a **confusion matrix** for performance visualization  
âœ… Displays **confidence scores** for predictions (optional)  
âœ… User-friendly **CLI or web-based interface**  
âœ… Gracefully handles mixed or uncertain emotions  

# Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization using **NLTK** or **spaCy**
- Word embeddings using **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, or **BERT embeddings**

### ðŸ”¹ Model Development
- Deep Learning models such as:
  - **LSTM / BiLSTM**
  - **Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT)**
- Trained on 70% of data, tested on 30%
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy

### ðŸ”¹ Evaluation
- Metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**
- Confusion matrix for visual comparison
- Confidence score for predicted emotion
